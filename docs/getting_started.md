## Sensu-Plugin Org Guidelines

### Overview

### Infrastructure

#### Github

GIthub and the issues and milestones within it are the primary way the project is managed.  All plugin repositories are created from a standard template using a rake task to ensure that they remain consistent and manageable at an organization level.  There are currently five teams in the org:

* Owners - unrestricted access to the org and all repos
* Admins - write access to all repos except core infrastructure
* Contributors - write access to all plugin repos
* Core Infra - write access to sensu-plugin, sensu-plugin-spec, GIR, Kryten, sensu-plugin.github.io, and tom_servo
* Documentation - write access to the documentation repo

#### Trello

There is a public Trello [organization](https://trello.com/sensuplugins) that has several boards used for communicating various project wide items.  This is still a work in progress but it works for now.  Ideas are always welcome, join a board and open a card.

#### [sensu-plugin.github.io](http://sensu-plugins.github.io/)

This is our temporary home until a more robust one can be created.

### Policies

This is a volunteer project and as such contributors are free to come and go.  No one is required to do any amount of work to continue as a contributor, some days you may do a ton of work or you may be on vacation or doing something that pays the bills for a few weeks.  No worries.

**Organization access**

This is a public organization and as such anyone may join the only requirements are a firm belief in treating your infrastructure as code and 2FA on your github account.  The rest is up for debate. :)
