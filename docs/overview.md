The goal of the Sensu Plugins project is to provide a set of community driven, high quality  plugins, handlers and other code to maximize the effective use of Sensu in various types of auto-scaling and traditional environments. Much of the code is written in Ruby and uses the sensu-plugin framework; some also depend on additional gems or packages(e.g. mysql2 or libopenssl-devel). Some are shell scripts! All languages are welcome but the preference is for pure Ruby when possible to ensure the broadest range of compatibility.
