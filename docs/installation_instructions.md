Installing via gem is the preferred method it one exists.

**Standard Installation**

Add the public key (if you havenâ€™t already) as a trusted certificate

```
gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensu-plugins/sensu-plugins.github.io/master/certs/sensu-plugins.pem)
gem install sensu-plugins-disk-checks -P MediumSecurity
```

You can also download the key from certs/ within each repository.

#### Chef

Using the Sensu **sensu_gem** LWRP
```
sensu_gem 'sensu-plugins-disk-checks' do
  version '0.0.1'
end
```

Using the Chef **package** resource
```
package 'sensu-plugins-disk-checks' do

## Usage

In a proper gem environment plugins can be executed directly from the command line. If you want to check the disk usage you could use the **check-disk-usage** plugin.  This will only work for ruby scripts.  Scripts in other langauges will still need to be called directly do to binstubs not being automatically created.

`check-disk-usage.rb -w 80 -c 90`

Depending on ruby environment you may need to call ruby directly

`/opt/sensu/embedded/bin/ruby check-disk-usage.rb -w 80 -c 90`

For details check the header file of a given plugin.
